## How To

Prototypes:
- `Entity` — Universal building block for other game elements. Implements dimentions, statuses and rendering.
- `Character` — Base class for the interactive characters (enemies, player). Inheritor of Entity.
- `Thing` — Base class for the environment objects (obstacle, projective).

Update sequence:
1. Entity changes (I/O logic, movement).
2. Clean up destroyed entities.
3. Collision detection.

Open local server on mobile device:
- Get IP: `ipconfig getifaddr en1`.
- Run vitejs with `--host <ip>`.
- Open final address on device.
